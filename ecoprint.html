                        Our assignment was to create an app to help people concerned about sustainability and our environment here in Canada
                        Our goal was to raise awareness and improve hopefulness for people aware of environmental issues, also help people see the positive impact they can make on the environment

                        <br><br>
                        as a nonprofit organization, we were not worried about monetization or revenue generation, our main focus was on user engagement and retention, thus a competitive analysis was not necessary for this project

                        <p>We decided the problem we were trying to solve with this project was to raise <strong>awareness</strong> about climate change, but also to give the user <strong>hopefulness</strong> that things can and will get better</p>

                        <p>We decided that it was most plausible to create an app that helps users track their environmental impact in an effort to reduce their carbon footprint</p>

                        The app would allow users to track their daily activities and see how they impact the environment. The app would also provide tips and resources on how to reduce their carbon footprint. It would also have an acheivement system to encourage users to make more sustainable choices, and always keep working to better impact the planet. It was meant to be low maintenence, the app would connect to other services to automatically track activities like transportation, energy usage, and waste production.

                        We tried to make a minimalist design that was easy to use and navigate. A user most likely wouldn't spend a lot of time on the app, so we wanted to make sure that they could quickly find the information they were looking for.

                        Part of our research during this project was to survey people about which design they preferred. We created a survey with 3 different designs and asked people to choose which one they liked the most and why.
